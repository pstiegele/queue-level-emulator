Based on our evaluation, Go is the most efficient language in context with raw sockets at the data link layer level. It's able to provide a very high network throughput with a very low latency. With the Queue Emulation Framework a good basis was developed so that many active queueing algorithm can be tested. In this case, the CoDel algorithm has been tested. Indeed, CoDel can combat against buffer bloat and keep the latency below 5ms periodically. The next steps could be the expansion of the AQM emulator with further AQM algorithms and a comparison among them.
